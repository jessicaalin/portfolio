      <h1>Hi, I'm Jessica.</h1>
      <h2>I'm a front-end developer.</h2>
      <p>
        In 2015, I graduated with my B.A. in Communication Arts. Soon after, I started working for a company based out of WeWork. Naturally, I was surrounded by startups, developers, and tech; I was curious about it all. That curiousity led to intrigue, and that intrigue led to passion. Fast-forward two years, and now I am a recent Ironhack graduate ready to make my passion my living.

        I love all things front-end and to bring a design into fruition. Currently, JavaScript is my main language and I work with the MEAN stack. Here you can check out some of my projects:
